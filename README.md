# GPMP2

This library is an implementation of GPMP2 (Gaussian Process Motion Planner 2) algorithm described in [Motion Planning as Probabilistic Inference using Gaussian Processes and Factor Graphs](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~bboots3/files/GPMP2.pdf) (RSS 2016). The core library is developed in C++ language with optional Python and MATLAB toolboxes. GPMP2 was started at the Georgia Tech Robot Learning Lab, see [THANKS](THANKS.md) for contributors.


## Prerequisites

- CMake >= 3.0 (Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install cmake`), compilation configuration tool.
- [Boost](http://www.boost.org/) >= 1.65 (Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev`), portable C++ source libraries.
- [GTSAM](https://github.com/borglab/gtsam/tree/develop), a C++ library that implements smoothing and mapping (SAM) framework in robotics and vision. Here we use the factor graph implementations and inference/optimization tools provided by GTSAM.
- [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/) needed if installing python toolbox.
- Matlab 2019b+ for the Matlab toolbox.

## Installation (C++ only)

- Install GTSAM.
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/borglab/gtsam.git
  cd gtsam
  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake -DGTSAM_ALLOW_DEPRECATED_SINCE_V42:=OFF .. # disable deprecated functionality for compatibility
  make -j4 check # optional, run unit tests  
  sudo make install
  ```

- Setup paths.
  ```bash
  echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}' >> ~/.bashrc
  echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/share:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}' >> ~/.bashrc
  source ~/.bashrc
  ```

- Install gpmp2.
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/borglab/gpmp2.git
  cd gpmp2 && mkdir build && cd build
  cmake ..
  make -j4 check  # optional, run unit tests
  sudo make install
  ```

## Python Package Installation

- [Optional] Setup virtual environment.
  ```bash
  conda create -n gpmp2 pip python=3.6
  conda activate gpmp2
  pip install cython numpy scipy matplotlib
  ```

- Install the `gtwrap` project.
  
  If you compile and install GTSAM with the python wrapper enabled, you will automatically have `gtwrap` and you can continue to the next step.
  Else, please clone and install the [gtwrap project](https://github.com/borglab/wrap).

  ```sh
  git clone git@github.com:borglab/wrap.git
  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake .. && make install
  ```

- Install `gpmp2`.
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/borglab/gpmp2.git
  cd gpmp2 && mkdir build && cd build
  cmake -DGPMP2_BUILD_PYTHON_TOOLBOX:=ON ..
  make -j8 # build
  make python-install # install the python package
  ```

At this point, you should be able to start a Python interpreter and load `gpmp2` via `import gpmp2`.

## Matlab Toolbox Installation

We clone, build and install `gpmp2` as usual, making sure to set the `GPMP2_BUILD_MATLAB_TOOLBOX` cmake flag.

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/borglab/gpmp2.git
  cd gpmp2 && mkdir build && cd build
  cmake -DGPMP2_BUILD_MATLAB_TOOLBOX:=ON ..
  make -j8 # build
  sudo make install
  ```

Start matlab and load the toolboxes be entering the following commands window:
```
addpath('/usr/local/gtsam_toolbox')
addpath('/usr/local/gpmp2_toolbox')
```
You should now be able to run any of the scripts in the `matlab/gpmp2_examples` directory.
